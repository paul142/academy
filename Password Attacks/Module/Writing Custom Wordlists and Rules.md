# Writing Custom Wordlists and Rules  
Many users create their passwords based on simplicity rather than security. To mitigate this human tendency (which often undermines security measures), password policies can be implemented on systems to enforce specific password requirements. For instance, a system might enforce the inclusion of uppercase letters, special characters, and numbers. Most password policies mandate a minimum length—typically eight characters—and require at least one character from each specified category.  
In the previous sections, we were successful at guessing simple passwords. However, it becomes significantly more challenging to apply these techniques to systems that require users to create more complex passwords.  
Unfortunately, the tendency for users to create weak passwords occurs even when password policies are in place. Most individuals follow predictable patterns when creating passwords, often incorporating words closely related to the service being accessed. For example, many employees choose passwords that include the company's name. Personal preferences and interests also play a significant role—these may include references to pets, friends, sports, hobbies, and other aspects of daily life. Basic OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) techniques can be highly effective in uncovering such personal information and may assist in password guessing. More information about OSINT can be found in the [OSINT: Corporate Recon module](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/osint-corporate-recon).

Commonly, users use the following additions for their password to fit the most common password policies:  

| Description                           | Password Syntax |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| First letter is uppercase             | Password        |
| Adding numbers                        | Password123     |
| Adding year                           | Password2022    |
| Adding month                          | Password02      |
| Last character is an exclamation mark | Password2022!   |
| Adding special characters             | P@ssw0rd2022!   |
  
Knowing that users tend to keep their passwords as simple as possible, we can create rules to generate likely weak passwords. According to statistics provided by [WP Engine](https://wpengine.com/resources/passwords-unmasked-infographic/), most passwords are no longer than ten characters. One approach is to select familiar terms that are at least five characters long—such as pet names, hobbies, personal preferences, or other common interests. For instance, if a user selects a single word (e.g., the current month), appends the current year, and adds a special character at the end, the result may satisfy a typical ten-character password requirement. Considering that most organizations require regular password changes, a user might modify their password by simply changing the name of the month or incrementing a single digit.  
Let's look at a simple example using a password list with only one entry.  
    
Writing Custom Wordlists and Rules  
```
Pavlo142@htb[/htb]$ cat password.list

```
We can use Hashcat to combine lists of potential names and labels with specific mutation rules to create custom wordlists. Hashcat uses a specific syntax to define characters, words, and their transformations. The complete syntax is documented in the official [Hashcat rule-based attack documentation](https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=rule_based_attack), but the examples below are sufficient to understand how Hashcat mutates input words.  

| Function | Description                                      |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| :        | Do nothing                                       |
| l        | Lowercase all letters                            |
| u        | Uppercase all letters                            |
| c        | Capitalize the first letter and lowercase others |
| sXY      | Replace all instances of X with Y                |
| $!       | Add the exclamation character at the end         |
  
Each rule is written on a new line and determines how a given word should be transformed. If we write the functions shown above into a file, it may look like this:  
    
Writing Custom Wordlists and Rules  
```
Pavlo142@htb[/htb]$ cat custom.rule

:
c
so0
c so0
sa@
c sa@
c sa@ so0
$
```
```
!

```
```
$! c
$
```
```
! so0

```
```
$
```
```
! sa@

```
```
$
```
```
! c so0

```
```
$! c sa@
$
```
```
! so0 sa@

```
```
$! c so0 sa@

```
We can use the following command to apply the rules in custom.rule to each word in password.list and store the mutated results in mut_password.list.  
    
Writing Custom Wordlists and Rules  
```
Pavlo142@htb[/htb]$ hashcat --force password.list -r custom.rule --stdout | sort -u > mut_password.list

```
In this case, the single input word will produce fifteen mutated variants.

```
Hashcat and JtR both come with pre-built rule lists that can be used for password generation and cracking. One of the most effective and widely used rulesets is best64.rule, which applies common transformations that frequently result in successful password guesses. It is important to note that password cracking and the creation of custom wordlists are, in most cases, a guessing game. We can narrow this down and perform more targeted guessing if we have information about the password policy, while considering factors such as the company name, geographical region, industry, and other topics or keywords that users might choose when creating their passwords. Exceptions, of course, include cases where passwords have been leaked and directly obtained.  
## Generating wordlists using CeWL  
We can use a tool called [CeWL](https://github.com/digininja/CeWL) to scan potential words from a company's website and save them in a separate list. We can then combine this list with the desired rules to create a customized password list—one that has a higher probability of containing the correct password for an employee. We specify some parameters, like the depth to spider (-d), the minimum length of the word (-m), the storage of the found words in lowercase (--lowercase), as well as the file where we want to store the results (-w).
