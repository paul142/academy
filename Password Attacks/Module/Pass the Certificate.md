# Pass the Certificate  
[PKINIT](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-pkca/d0cf1763-3541-4008-a75f-a577fa5e8c5b), short for ****Public Key Cryptography for Initial Authentication****, is an extension of the Kerberos protocol that enables the use of public key cryptography during the initial authentication exchange. It is typically used to support user logons via smart cards, which store the private keys. ****Pass-the-Certificate**** refers to the technique of using X.509 certificates to successfully obtain ****Ticket Granting Tickets (TGTs)****. This method is used primarily alongside [attacks against Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS)](https://www.specterops.io/assets/resources/Certified_Pre-Owned.pdf), as well as in [Shadow Credential](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-adts/f70afbcc-780e-4d91-850c-cfadce5bb15c) attacks.  
## AD CS NTLM Relay Attack (ESC8)  
## Note: Attacks against Active Directory Certificate Services are covered in great depth in the [ADCS Attacks](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/details/236) module.  
****ESC8****—as described in the [Certified Pre-Owned](https://www.specterops.io/assets/resources/Certified_Pre-Owned.pdf) paper—is an NTLM relay attack targeting an ADCS HTTP endpoint. ADCS supports multiple enrollment methods, ****including web enrollment****, which by default occurs over HTTP. A certificate authority configured to allow web enrollment typically hosts the following application at ****/CertSrv****:

Pass the Certificate  
```
Pavlo142@htb[/htb]$ impacket-ntlmrelayx -t http://10.129.234.110/certsrv/certfnsh.asp --adcs -smb2support --template KerberosAuthentication

```
## Note: The value passed to --template may be different in other environments. This is simply the certificate template which is used by Domain Controllers for authentication. This can be enumerated with tools like [certipy](https://github.com/ly4k/Certipy).  
Attackers can either wait for victims to attempt authentication against their machine randomly, or they can actively coerce them into doing so. One way to force machine accounts to authenticate against arbitrary hosts is by exploiting the [printer bug](https://github.com/dirkjanm/krbrelayx/blob/master/printerbug.py). This attack requires the targeted machine account to have the ****Printer Spooler**** service running. The command below forces ****10.129.234.109 (DC01)**** to attempt authentication against ****10.10.16.12 (attacker host)****:  
    
Pass the Certificate  
```

We can now perform a ****Pass-the-Certificate**** attack to obtain a TGT as ****DC01$****. One way to do this is by using [gettgtpkinit.py](https://github.com/dirkjanm/PKINITtools/blob/master/gettgtpkinit.py). First, let's clone the repository and install the dependencies:  
    
    
Pass the Certificate

```
Pavlo142@htb[/htb]$ git clone https://github.com/dirkjanm/PKINITtools.git && cd PKINITtools

Pavlo142@htb[/htb]$ source .venv/bin/activate
Pavlo142@htb
```
```
[/htb]$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt

```
Then, we can begin the attack.  
## Note: If you encounter error stating "Error detecting the version of libcrypto", it can be fixed by installing the [oscrypto](https://github.com/wbond/oscrypto) library.

```
Once we successfully obtain a TGT, we're back in familiar Pass-the-Ticket (PtT) territory. As the domain controller's machine account, we can perform a DCSync attack to, for example, retrieve the NTLM hash of the domain administrator account:

## Shadow Credentials (msDS-KeyCredentialLink)  
[Shadow Credentials](https://posts.specterops.io/shadow-credentials-abusing-key-trust-account-mapping-for-takeover-8ee1a53566ab) refers to an Active Directory attack that abuses the [msDS-KeyCredentialLink](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-adts/f70afbcc-780e-4d91-850c-cfadce5bb15c) attribute of a victim user. This attribute stores public keys that can be used for authentication via PKINIT. In BloodHound, the ****AddKeyCredentialLink**** edge indicates that one user has write permissions over another user's ****msDS-KeyCredentialLink**** attribute, allowing them to take control of that user.  
![PINGMUNŞINLANEFROIGHTLOCAL](Attachments/B639D33B-25CF-496C-9CC2-03C114674ECB.png)  
We can use [pywhisker](https://github.com/ShutdownRepo/pywhisker) to perform this attack from a Linux system. The command below generates an ****X.509 certificate**** and writes the ****public key**** to the victim user's ****msDS-KeyCredentialLink**** attribute:  
    
    
Pass the Certificate  
Pass the Certificate  
```
Pavlo142@htb[/htb]$ pywhisker --dc-ip 10.129.234.109 -d INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL -u wwhite -p 'package5shores_topher1' --target jpinkman --action add

```
In the output above, we can see that a ****PFX (PKCS12)**** file was created (****eFUVVTPf.pfx****), and the password is shown. We will use this file with ****gettgtpkinit.py**** to acquire a TGT as the victim:

```
With the TGT obtained, we may once again ****pass the ticket****:  
    
    
Pass the Certificate  
```
Pavlo142@htb[/htb]$ export KRB5CCNAME=/tmp/jpinkman.ccache
Pavlo142@htb
```
```

```
In this case, we discovered that the victim user is a member of the ****Remote Management Users**** group, which permits them to connect to the machine via ****WinRM****. As demonstrated in the previous section, we can use ****Evil-WinRM**** to connect using Kerberos (note: ensure that ****krb5.conf**** is properly configured):

## No PKINIT?  
In certain environments, an attacker may be able to obtain a certificate but be unable to use it for pre-authentication as specific victims (e.g., a domain controller machine account) due to the KDC not supporting the appropriate EKU. The tool [PassTheCert](https://github.com/AlmondOffSec/PassTheCert/) was created for such situations. It can be used to authenticate against LDAPS using a certificate and perform various attacks (e.g., changing passwords or granting DCSync rights). This attack is outside the scope of this module but is worth reading about [here](https://offsec.almond.consulting/authenticating-with-certificates-when-pkinit-is-not-supported.html).  
  
## Onwards  
Now that we've seen how to perform various lateral movement techniques from Windows and Linux hosts, we'll pivot to a new focus: password management. Note that we recommend practicing all these lateral movement techniques until they become second nature. You never know what you will run into during an assessment, so having an extensive toolset to fall back on is critical.
