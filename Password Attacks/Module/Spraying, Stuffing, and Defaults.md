# Spraying, Stuffing, and Defaults  
## Password spraying  
[Password spraying](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Password_Spraying_Attack) is a type of brute-force attack in which an attacker attempts to use a single password across many different user accounts. This technique can be particularly effective in environments where users are initialized with a default or standard password. For example, if it is known that administrators at a particular company commonly use ****ChangeMe123!**** when setting up new accounts, it would be worthwhile to spray this password across all user accounts to identify any that were not updated.  
Depending on the target system, different tools may be used to carry out password spraying attacks. For web applications, [Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/burp) is a strong option, while for Active Directory environments, tools such as [NetExec](https://github.com/Pennyw0rth/NetExec) or [Kerbrute](https://github.com/ropnop/kerbrute) are commonly used.

```
## Credential stuffing  
[Credential stuffing](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Credential_stuffing) is another type of brute-force attack in which an attacker uses stolen credentials from one service to attempt access on others. Since many users reuse their usernames and passwords across multiple platforms (such as email, social media, and enterprise systems), these attacks are sometimes successful. As with password spraying, credential stuffing can be carried out using a variety of tools, depending on the target system. For example, if we have a list of ****username:password**** credentials obtained from a database leak, we can use ****hydra**** to perform a credential stuffing attack against an SSH service using the following syntax:

Pavlo142@htb[/htb]$ hydra -C user_pass.list ssh://10.100.38.23

```
## Default credentials  
Many systems—such as routers, firewalls, and databases—come with ****default credentials****. While best practice dictates that administrators change these credentials during setup, they are sometimes left unchanged, posing a serious security risk.  
While several lists of known default credentials are available online, there are also dedicated tools that automate the process. One widely used example is the [Default Credentials Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/ihebski/DefaultCreds-cheat-sheet), which we can install with ****pip3****.

Once installed, we can use the ****creds**** command to search for known default credentials associated with a specific product or vendor.

In addition to publicly available lists and tools, default credentials can often be found in product documentation, which typically outlines the steps required to set up a service. While some devices and applications prompt the user to set a password during installation, others use a default—often weak—password.  
Let's imagine we have identified certain applications in use on a customer's network. After researching the default credentials online, we can combine them into a new list, formatted as ****username:password****, and reuse the previously mentioned ****hydra**** command to attempt access.  
Beyond applications, default credentials are also commonly associated with routers. One such list is available [here](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/default-router-username-and-password-list/). While it is less likely that router credentials remain unchanged (since these devices are critical to network security), oversights do occur. Routers used in internal testing environments, for example, may be left with default settings and can be exploited to gain further access.
