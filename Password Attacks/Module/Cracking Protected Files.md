# Cracking Protected Files  
The use of file encryption is often neglected in both ****private**** and ****professional**** contexts. Even today, emails containing job applications, account statements, or contracts are frequently sent without encryption—sometimes in violation of legal regulations. For example, within the European Union, the [General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](https://gdpr-info.eu/) requires that personal data be encrypted both in transit and at rest. Nevertheless, it remains standard practice to discuss ****confidential**** topics or transmit ****sensitive**** data via email, which may be intercepted by attackers positioned to exploit these communication channels.  
As more companies enhance their IT security infrastructure through training programs and security awareness seminars, it is becoming increasingly common for employees to encrypt sensitive files. Nevertheless, encrypted files can still be cracked and accessed with the right combination of wordlists and tools. In many cases, ****symmetric encryption**** algorithms such as ****AES-256**** are used to securely store individual files or folders. In this method, the same key is used for both encryption and decryption. For transmitting files, ****asymmetric encryption**** is typically employed, which uses two distinct keys: the sender encrypts the file with the recipient's ****public key****, and the recipient decrypts it using the corresponding ****private ke****y.  
Up until now, we've focused on cracking password hashes specifically. In the next two sections, we will shift our focus to techniques related to attacking password-protected files and archives.  
## Hunting for Encrypted Files  
Many different extensions correspond to encrypted files—a useful reference list can be found on [FileInfo](https://fileinfo.com/filetypes/encoded). As an example, consider this command we might use to locate commonly encrypted files on a Linux system:  
    
Cracking Protected Files  
```
Pavlo142@htb[/htb]$ for ext in $(echo ".xls .xls* .xltx .od* .doc .doc* .pdf .pot .pot* .pp*");do echo -e "\nFile extension: " $ext; find / -name *$ext 2>/dev/null | grep -v "lib\|fonts\|share\|core" ;done

File extension:  .xls

File extension:  .xls*

File extension:  .xltx

File extension:  .od*
/home/cry0l1t3/Docs/document-temp.odt
/home/cry0l1t3/Docs/product-improvements.odp
/home/cry0l1t3/Docs/mgmt-spreadsheet.ods
...SNIP...

```
If we encounter file extensions on a system that we are unfamiliar with, we can use search engines to research the technology behind them. There are, after all, hundreds of different file extensions, and no one is expected to know all of them by heart.  
## Hunting for SSH keys  
Certain files, such as SSH keys, do not have standard file extension. In cases like these, it may be possible to identify files by standard content such as header and footer values. For example, SSH private keys always begin with ****-----BEGIN [...SNIP...] PRIVATE KEY-----****. We can use tools like ****grep**** to recursively search the file system for them during post-exploitation.  
    
Cracking Protected Files  
```
Pavlo142@htb[/htb]$ grep -rnE '^\-{5}BEGIN [A-Z0-9]+ PRIVATE KEY\-{5}$' /* 2>/dev/null

/home/jsmith/.ssh/id_ed25519:1:-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
/home/jsmith/.ssh/SSH.private:1:-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
/home/jsmith/Documents/id_rsa:1:-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
<SNIP>

```
Some SSH keys are encrypted with a passphrase. With older PEM formats, it was possible to tell if an SSH key is encrypted based on the header, which contains the encryption method in use. Modern SSH keys, however, appear the same whether encrypted or not.  
    
Cracking Protected Files  
```
Pavlo142@htb[/htb]$ cat /home/jsmith/.ssh/SSH.private

-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
Proc-Type: 4,ENCRYPTED
DEK-Info: AES-128-CBC,2109D25CC91F8DBFCEB0F7589066B2CC

8Uboy0afrTahejVGmB7kgvxkqJLOczb1I0/hEzPU1leCqhCKBlxYldM2s65jhflD
4/OH4ENhU7qpJ62KlrnZhFX8UwYBmebNDvG12oE7i21hB/9UqZmmHktjD3+OYTsD
<SNIP>

```
One way to tell whether an SSH key is encrypted or not, is to try reading the key with ****ssh-keygen****.  
    
Cracking Protected Files  
```
Pavlo142@htb[/htb]$ ssh-keygen -yf ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 

ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIIpNefJd834VkD5iq+22Zh59Gzmmtzo6rAffCx2UtaS6

```
As shown below, attempting to read a password-protected SSH key will prompt the user for a passphrase:  
    
Cracking Protected Files  
```
Pavlo142@htb[/htb]$ ssh-keygen -yf ~/.ssh/id_rsa

Enter passphrase for "/home/jsmith/.ssh/id_rsa":

```
## Cracking encrypted SSH keys  
As mentioned in a previous section, JtR has many different scripts for extracting hashes from files—which we can then proceed to crack. We can find these scripts on our system using the following command:  
    
Cracking Protected Files  
```
Pavlo142@htb[/htb]$ locate *2john*

/usr/bin/bitlocker2john
/usr/bin/dmg2john
/usr/bin/gpg2john
/usr/bin/hccap2john
/usr/bin/keepass2john
/usr/bin/putty2john
/usr/bin/racf2john
/usr/bin/rar2john
/usr/bin/uaf2john
/usr/bin/vncpcap2john
/usr/bin/wlanhcx2john
/usr/bin/wpapcap2john
/usr/bin/zip2john
/usr/share/john/1password2john.py
/usr/share/john/7z2john.pl
/usr/share/john/DPAPImk2john.py
/usr/share/john/adxcsouf2john.py
/usr/share/john/aem2john.py
/usr/share/john/aix2john.pl
/usr/share/john/aix2john.py
/usr/share/john/andotp2john.py
/usr/share/john/androidbackup2john.py
<SNIP>

```
For example, we could use the Python script ****ssh2john.py**** to acquire the corresponding hash for an encrypted SSH key, and then use JtR to try and crack it.  
    
Cracking Protected Files  
```
Pavlo142@htb[/htb]$ ssh2john.py SSH.private > ssh.hash
Pavlo142@htb[/htb]$ john --wordlist=rockyou.txt ssh.hash

```
We can then view the resulting hash:  
    
Cracking Protected Files  
```
Pavlo142@htb[/htb]$ john ssh.hash --show

SSH.private:1234

1 password hash cracked, 0 left

```
## Cracking password-protected documents  
Over the course of our careers, we are likely to encounter a wide variety of documents that are password-protected to restrict access to authorized individuals. Today, most reports, documentation, and information sheets are commonly distributed as Microsoft Office documents or PDFs. John the Ripper (JtR) includes a Python script called ****office2john.py****, which can be used to extract password hashes from all common Office document formats. These hashes can then be supplied to JtR or Hashcat for offline cracking. The cracking procedure remains consistent with other hash types.  
    
Cracking Protected Files  
```
Pavlo142@htb[/htb]$ office2john.py Protected.docx > protected-docx.hash
Pavlo142@htb[/htb]$ john --wordlist=rockyou.txt protected-docx.hash
Pavlo142@htb[/htb]$ john protected-docx.hash --show

Protected.docx:1234

1 password hash cracked, 0 left

```
The process for cracking PDF files is quite similar, as we simply swap out ****office2john.py**** for ****pdf2john.py****.  
    
Cracking Protected Files  
```
Pavlo142@htb[/htb]$ pdf2john.py PDF.pdf > pdf.hash
Pavlo142@htb[/htb]$ john --wordlist=rockyou.txt pdf.hash
Pavlo142@htb[/htb]$ john pdf.hash --show

PDF.pdf:1234

1 password hash cracked, 0 left

```
One of the primary challenges in this process is the generation and mutation of password lists, which is a prerequisite for successfully cracking password-protected files and access points. In many cases, using a standard or publicly known password list is no longer sufficient, as such lists are often recognized and blocked by built-in security mechanisms. These files may also be more difficult to crack—or not crackable at all within a reasonable timeframe—because users are increasingly required to choose longer, randomly generated passwords or complex passphrases. Nevertheless, attempting to crack password-protected documents is often worthwhile, as they may contain sensitive information that can be leveraged to gain further access.
