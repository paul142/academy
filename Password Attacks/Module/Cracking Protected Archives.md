# Cracking Protected Archives  
**Besides standalone files, we will often run across archives and compressed files—such as ZIP files—which are protected with a password.**  
Let us assume the role of an employee at an administrative company and imagine that a client requests a summary of an analysis in various formats, such as Excel, PDF, Word, and a corresponding presentation. One approach would be to send these files individually. However, if we extend this scenario to a large organization managing multiple simultaneous projects, this method of file transfer can become cumbersome and may result in individual files being misplaced. In such cases, employees often rely on archive files, which allow them to organize necessary documents in a structured manner (typically using subfolders) before compressing them into a single, consolidated file.  
**There are many types of archive files. Some of the more commonly encountered file extensions include tar, gz, rar, zip, vmdb/vmx, cpt, truecrypt, bitlocker, kdbx, deb, 7z, and gzip.**  
## A comprehensive list of archive file types can be found on [FileInfo](https://fileinfo.com/filetypes/compressed). Rather than typing them out manually, we can also query the data using a one-liner, apply filters as needed, and save the results to a file. At the time of writing, the website lists 365 archive file types.

Pavlo142@htb[/htb]$ curl -s https://fileinfo.com/filetypes/compressed | html2text | awk '{print tolower($1)}' | grep "\." | tee -a compressed_ext.txt

.zst

.vrpackage

```
## Note that not all archive types support native password protection, and in such cases, additional tools are often used to encrypt the files. For example, TAR files are commonly encrypted using openssl or gpg.  
## Given the wide variety of archive formats and encryption tools, this section will focus only on a selection of methods for cracking specific archive types. For password-protected archives, we typically require specialized scripts to extract password hashes from the files, which can then be used in offline cracking attempts.  
## Cracking ZIP files  
## The ZIP format is often heavily used in Windows environments to compress many files into one file. The process of cracking an encrypted ZIP file is similar to what we have seen already, except for using a different script to extract the hashes.

Pavlo142@htb[/htb]$ zip2john ZIP.zip > zip.hash
Pavlo142@htb
```
```
[/htb]$ cat zip.hash 

```
```

```
## Once we have extracted the hash, we can use JtR to crack it with the desired password list.

Pavlo142@htb[/htb]$ john --wordlist=rockyou.txt zip.hash

## Cracking OpenSSL encrypted GZIP files  
## It is not always immediately apparent whether a file is password-protected, particularly when the file extension corresponds to a format that does not natively support password protection. As previously discussed, openssl can be used to encrypt files in the GZIP format. To determine the actual format of a file, we can use the file command, which provides detailed information about its contents. For example:  
    
Cracking Protected Archives  
```
Pavlo142@htb[/htb]$ file GZIP.gzip 

GZIP.gzip: openssl enc'd data with salted password

```
## When cracking OpenSSL encrypted files, we may encounter various challenges, including numerous false positives or complete failure to identify the correct password. To mitigate this, a more reliable approach is to use the openssl tool within a for loop that attempts to extract the contents directly, succeeding only if the correct password is found.  
## The following one-liner may produce several GZIP-related error messages, which can be safely ignored. If the correct password list is used, as in this example, we will see another file successfully extracted from the archive.

```
Pavlo142@htb[/htb]$ for i in $(cat rockyou.txt);do openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -d -in GZIP.gzip -k $i 2>/dev/null| tar xz;done

gzip: stdin: not in gzip format
tar: Child returned status 1
tar: Error is not recoverable: exiting now

gzip: stdin: not in gzip format
tar: Child returned status 1
tar: Error is not recoverable: exiting now
<SNIP>

```
## Once the for loop has finished, we can check the current directory for a newly extracted file.

## Cracking BitLocker-encrypted drives  
**[BitLocker](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/information-protection/bitlocker/bitlocker-device-encryption-overview-windows-10) is a full-disk encryption feature developed by Microsoft for the Windows operating system. Available since Windows Vista, it uses the AES encryption algorithm with either 128-bit or 256-bit key lengths. If the password or PIN used for BitLocker is forgotten, decryption can still be performed using a recovery key—a 48-digit string generated during the setup process.**

## In enterprise environments, virtual drives are sometimes used to store personal information, documents, or notes on company-issued devices to prevent unauthorized access. To crack a BitLocker encrypted drive, we can use a script called bitlocker2john to [four different hashes](https://openwall.info/wiki/john/OpenCL-BitLocker): the first two correspond to the BitLocker password, while the latter two represent the recovery key. Because the recovery key is very long and randomly generated, it is generally not practical to guess—unless partial knowledge is available. Therefore, we will focus on cracking the password using the first hash ($bitlocker$0$...).

```
Pavlo142@htb[/htb]$ bitlocker2john -i Backup.vhd > backup.hashes
Pavlo142@htb[/htb]$ grep "bitlocker\$0" backup.hashes > backup.hash
Pavlo142@htb[/htb]$ cat backup.hash

$
```
```

```
## Once a hash is generated, either JtR or hashcat can be used to crack it. For this example, we will look at the procedure with hashcat. The hashcat mode associated with the $bitlocker$0$... hash is -m 22100. We supply the hash, specify the wordlist, and define the hash mode. Since this encryption uses strong AES encryption, cracking may take considerable time depending on hardware performance.

## After successfully cracking the password, we can access the encrypted drive.  
## Mounting BitLocker-encrypted drives in Windows  
## The easiest method for mounting a BitLocker-encrypted virtual drive on Windows is to double-click the .vhd file. Since it is encrypted, Windows will initially show an error. After mounting, simply double-click the BitLocker volume to be prompted for the password.  
![*******](Attachments/3089DC70-EF6E-4CBD-82F7-AD12263E87AF.png)  
## Mounting BitLocker-encrypted drives in Linux (or macOS)  
## It is also possible to mount BitLocker-encrypted drives in Linux (or macOS). To do this, we can use a tool called [dislocker](https://github.com/Aorimn/dislocker). First, we need to install the package using apt:  
    
Cracking Protected Archives  
```
Pavlo142@htb[/htb]$ sudo apt-get install dislocker

```
## Next, we create two folders which we will use to mount the VHD.  
    
Cracking Protected Archives  
```
Pavlo142@htb[/htb]$ sudo mkdir -p /media/bitlocker
Pavlo142@htb
```
```
[/htb]$ sudo mkdir -p /media/bitlockermount

```
## We then use losetup to configure the VHD as [loop device](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_device), decrypt the drive using dislocker, and finally mount the decrypted volume:  
    
Cracking Protected Archives  
```
Pavlo142@htb[/htb]$ sudo losetup -f -P Backup.vhd
Pavlo142@htb
```
```
[/htb]$ sudo dislocker /dev/loop0p2 -u1234qwer -- /media/bitlocker

```
```
Pavlo142@htb[/htb]$ sudo mount -o loop /media/bitlocker/dislocker-file /media/bitlockermount

```
## If everything was done correctly, we can now browse the files:  
    
Cracking Protected Archives  
Cracking Protected Archives  
```
Pavlo142@htb[/htb]$ cd /media/bitlockermount/
Pavlo142@htb[/htb]$ ls -la

```
## Once we have analyzed the files on the mounted drive, we can unmount it using the following commands:  
    
Cracking Protected Archives  
Cracking Protected Archives  
```
Pavlo142@htb[/htb]$ sudo umount /media/bitlockermount
Pavlo142@htb
```
```
[/htb]$ sudo umount /media/bitlocker

```
