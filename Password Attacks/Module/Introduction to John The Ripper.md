# Introduction to John The Ripper  
[John the Ripper](https://github.com/openwall/john) (aka. JtR aka. john) is a well-known penetration testing tool used for cracking passwords through various attacks including brute-force and dictionary. It is open-source software initially developed for UNIX-based systems and was first released in 1996. It has become a staple of the security industry due to its various capabilities. The "jumbo" variant is recommended for our uses, as it has performance optimizations, additional features such as multilingual word lists, and support for 64-bit architectures. This version is able to crack passwords with greater accuracy and speed. Included with JtR are various tools for converting different types of files and hashes into formats that are usable by JtR. Additionally, the software is regularly updated to keep up with the current security trends and technologies.  
## Cracking modes  
## Single crack mode  
Single crack mode is a rule-based cracking technique that is most useful when targeting Linux credentials. It generates password candidates based on the victim's username, home directory name, and [GECOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gecos_field) values (full name, room number, phone number, etc.). These strings are run against a large set of rules that apply common string modifications seen in passwords (e.g. a user whose real name is Bob Smith might use Smith1 as their password).  
**Note:** The Linux authentication process, as well as cracking rules, will be covered in-depth in later sections. The following example is simplified for demonstration purposes.

Imagine we as attackers came across the file passwd with the following contents:  
Imagine we as attackers came across the file passwd with the following contents:  
r0lf:$6$ues25dIanlctrWxg$nZHVz2z4kCy1760Ee28M1xtHdGoy0C2cYzZ8l2sVa1kIa8K9gAcdBP.GI6ng/qA4oaMrgElZ1Cb9OeXO4Fvy3/:0:0:Rolf Sebastian:/home/r0lf:/bin/bash  
Based on the contents of the file, it can be inferred that the victim has the username r0lf, the real name Rolf Sebastian, and the home directory /home/r0lf. Single crack mode will use this information to generate candidate passwords and test them against the hash. We can run the attack with the following command:

Pavlo142@htb[/htb]$ john --single passwd

```
```

```
```

Use the "--show" option to display all of the cracked passwords reliably
Session completed.

```
In this case, the password hash was successfully cracked.  
## Wordlist mode  
Wordlist mode is used to crack passwords with a dictionary attack, meaning it attempts all passwords in a supplied wordlist against the password hash. The basic syntax for the command is as follows:  
    
    
Introduction to John The Ripper  
```
Pavlo142@htb[/htb]$ john --wordlist=<wordlist_file> <hash_file>

```
The wordlist file (or files) used for cracking password hashes must be in plain text format, with one word per line. Multiple wordlists can be specified by separating them with a comma. Rules, either custom or built-in, can be specified by using the --rules argument. These can be applied to generate candidate passwords using transformations such as appending numbers, capitalizing letters and adding special characters.  
## Incremental mode  
Incremental mode is a powerful, brute-force-style password cracking mode that generates candidate passwords based on a statistical model ([Markov chains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain)). It is designed to test all character combinations defined by a specific character set, prioritizing more likely passwords based on training data.  
This mode is the most exhaustive, but also the most time-consuming. It generates password guesses dynamically and does not rely on a predefined wordlist, in contrast to wordlist mode. Unlike purely random brute-force attacks, Incremental mode uses a statistical model to make educated guesses, resulting in a significantly more efficient approach than naïve brute-force attacks.  
The basic syntax is:  
    
Introduction to John The Ripper  
Introduction to John The Ripper  
```
Pavlo142@htb[/htb]$ john --incremental <hash_file>

```
By default, JtR uses predefined incremental modes specified in its configuration file (john.conf), which define character sets and password lengths. You can customize these or define your own to target passwords that use special characters or specific patterns.  
    
    
Introduction to John The Ripper  
```
Pavlo142@htb[/htb]$ grep '# Incremental modes' -A 100 /etc/john/john.conf

#
```
```
 Incremental modes

```
```

# This is for one-off uses (make your own custom.chr).
# A charset can now also be named directly from command-line, so no config
#
```
```
 entry needed: --incremental=whatever.chr

```
```
[Incremental:Custom]
File = $JOHN/custom.chr
MinLen = 0

# The theoretical CharCount is 211, we've got 196.
[Incremental:UTF8]
File = $JOHN/utf8.chr
MinLen = 0
CharCount = 196

# This is CP1252, a super-set of ISO-8859-1.
# The theoretical CharCount is 219, we'
```
```
ve got 203.

```
```
[Incremental:Latin1]
File = $JOHN/latin1.chr
MinLen = 0
CharCount = 203

[Incremental:ASCII]
File = 
```
```
$JOHN/ascii.chr

```
```
MinLen = 0
MaxLen = 13
CharCount = 95

...SNIP...

```
**Note:** This mode can be resource-intensive and slow, especially for long or complex passwords. Customizing the character set and length can improve performance and focus the attack.  
## Identifying hash formats  
Sometimes, password hashes may appear in an unknown format, and even John the Ripper (JtR) may not be able to identify them with complete certainty. For example, consider the following hash:  
193069ceb0461e1d40d216e32c79c704  
One way to get an idea is to consult [JtR's sample hash documentation](https://openwall.info/wiki/john/sample-hashes), or [this list by PentestMonkey](https://pentestmonkey.net/cheat-sheet/john-the-ripper-hash-formats). Both sources list multiple example hashes as well as the corresponding JtR format. Another option is to use a tool like [hashID](https://github.com/psypanda/hashID), which checks supplied hashes against a built-in list to suggest potential formats. By adding the -j flag, hashID will, in addition to the hash format, list the corresponding JtR format:

Unfortunately, in our example it is still quite unclear what format the hash is in. This will sometimes be the case, and is simply one of the "problems" you will encounter as a pentester. Many times, the context of where the hash came from will be enough to make an educated case on the format. In this specific example, the hash format is RIPEMD-128.  
JtR supports hundreds of hash formats, some of which are listed in the table below. The --format argument can be supplied to instruct JtR which format target hashes have.
