# Introduction

Confidentiality, integrity, and availability are at the core of every infosec practitioner's responsibilities. Without maintaining a balance among them, we cannot ensure the security of our enterprises. This balance is preserved by auditing and accounting for each file, object, and host in the environment; by validating that users have appropriate permissions (authorization) to access those resources; and by verifying each user's identity (authentication) before granting access. Most breaches can be traced back to the breakdown of one of these three principles. This module focuses on attacking and bypassing the tenet of authentication by compromising user passwords across various operating systems, applications, and encryption methods. Before diving into the exciting part, attacking passwords, let's take a moment to discuss authentication and its components.

## Authentication

Authentication, at its core, is the validation of your identity by presenting a combination of four factors to a validation mechanism. They are:

1.  Something you know: a password, passcode, PIN, passphrase, etc.
2.  Something you have: an ID card, smart card, trusted device/phone, etc.
3.  Something you are: biometric characteristics such as fingerprint, face recognition, iris/retina, voice, etc.
4.  Somewhere you are: geolocation, IP address, etc.

The process can require any or all of these authentication factors. These methods will be determined based on the severity of the information or systems accessed and how much protection they need. For example, doctors are often required to utilize a Common Access Card (CAC) paired with a pin-code or password to access any terminals that input or store patient data. Depending on the maturity of the organization's security posture, they could require all three types (A CAC, password, and pin from an authenticator app, for example).  
Another simple example of this is access to our email address. The proof of information, in this case, would be the knowledge of the email address itself and the associated password. For example, a cell phone with 2FA can be used. The third aspect can also play a role: the user's presence through biometric recognition such as a fingerprint or facial recognition.  
In the previous example, the password is the authentication identifier that can be bypassed with different TTPs. This level is about authenticating the identity. Usually, only the owner and authenticating authority know the password. Authorization is carried out if the correct password is given to the authentication authority. Authorization, in this case, is the set of permissions that the user is granted upon successful authentication.

## The use of passwords

The most common and widely used authentication method is still the use of passwords. But what is a password? A password or passphrase can be generally defined as a combination of letters, numbers, and symbols in a string for identity validation. For example, if we work with passwords and take a standard 8-digit password that consists only of upper case letters and numbers, we would get a total of 36⁸ (208,827,064,576) possible passwords.  
Realistically, it doesn't need to be a combination of those things. It could be a lyric from a song or poem, a line from a book, a phrase you can remember, or even randomly generated words concatenated together like "TreeDogEvilElephant." The key is for it to meet or exceed the security standards in place by your organization. Using multiple layers to establish identity can make the entire authentication process complicated and costly. Adding complexity to the authentication process creates further effort that can add to the stresses and workload a person may have during a typical workday. Complex systems can often require inconvenient manual processes or additional steps that could significantly complicate the interaction and user experience (UX). Consider the process of shopping at an online store. Creating an account on the store website can make the authentication and checkout processes much faster than manually inputting your personal information each time you wish to make a purchase. For this reason, using a username and password to secure an account is the most widespread method of authentication that we will see again and again while keeping in mind this balance of convenience and security.

A [survey](https://web.archive.org/web/20201115110047/https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/documents/PasswordCheckup-HarrisPoll-InfographicFINAL.pdf) conducted by Google and Harris Poll in 2019 reveals that 24% of Americans have used passwords like 123456, qwerty and password. At the time, only 15% of Americans used password managers. It is also stated that 22% used their name, and 33% used the name of their pet or children. Another critical statistic is the password re-use across multiple accounts being 66%. This means that 66% of all Americans, according to this statistic, have used the same password for multiple platforms. Therefore, once we have obtained or guessed a password, there is a 66% chance that we could use it to authenticate ourselves on other platforms with the user's ID (username or email address). This would, of course, require that we are able to guess the user's user ID, which, in many cases, is not difficult to do.

[Statistics](https://web.archive.org/web/20250405101232/https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/password-statistics/) compiled by Panda Security in 2025 show that these trends remain similar, with some signs of improvement. 123456 is still the most common password, appearing 4.5 million times in data breaches, and at least 23% reuse passwords across three accounts or more. However, 36% of Americans have adopted password managers, which is more than double the figure from 6 years prior.  
One aspect of Google's survey that is somewhat more difficult to understand is that only 45% of Americans would change their passwords after a data breach. This, in turn, means that 55% still keep the password even though it has already been leaked. We can also check if one of our email addresses is affected by various data breaches. One of the best-known sources for this is [HaveIBeenPwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/). We enter an email address in the HaveIBeenPwned website, and it checks in its database if the email address has already been affected by any reported data breaches. If this is the case, we will see a list of all of the breaches in which our email address appears.

## Digging in

Now that we have defined what a password is, how we use them, and common security principles, let's dive into how we store passwords and other credentials.
